## IDEAS

1. Add sound board (!play {sound name}) - This requires adding all the sounds to the "help - available sounds section"

2. Voice change (!voicechange {user} {effect})

3. Echo prank: Add an "echo" or "reverb" prank where the bot mimics a user after a delay, repeating whatever they just said with a funny echo.

4.

- 4.1 Compliment or Roast Mode: Users can request the bot to either roast or compliment someone. The bot will have a collection of funny audio roasts or compliments ready to play.
- 4.2 Random shoutouts: The bot could occasionally give random shoutouts to people in the voice channel or text channel with funny messages or audio clips.

5.

- 5.1 Voice AI conversations: Integrate some simple AI-based conversation triggers where users can talk to the bot in the voice channel, and it responds with pre-recorded or text-to-speech audio responses.
- 5.2 Meme generator: Have the bot respond to certain phrases by creating short meme-style audio or text messages.

6. Funny Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech

- 6.1 Text-to-Speech responses: Allow users to send messages in the chat, and the bot reads them out in a funny voice. You could even have different voice options for users to pick from.
- 6.2 Voice-to-Text chat: Use speech recognition to transcribe usersâ€™ speech into text in a funny or exaggerated way, adding humor with incorrect transcriptions.

## NEXT (TO-DO)

1. Do not play sounds that have already been played (mark audio clips as "played" and do not replay until all clips have been played)
2. Play specific sound when user enters/leaves the chat
3. Remove greetAll function (improve and use playSound - remove joinChannel from it)
